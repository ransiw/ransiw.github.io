I am a 4th year grad student at Caltech's HSS program. And I specialize on estimating dynamic causal effects, particularly of aggregate political units. I have a preference for modular estimators that easily render for diagnostics. I design and implement the methods and apply to a wide range of treatment settings including democratization.
