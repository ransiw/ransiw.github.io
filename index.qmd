I specialize in estimating dynamic causal effects of aggregate political units. I have a preference for modular estimators that easily render for diagnostics. I design and implement the methods and apply to a wide range of treatment settings including democratization, natural disasters, and other electorally relevant phenomena. I publish and maintain open source software.

I also have a specific policy interest in nuclear energy and occasionally field surveys to gauge public opinion on the nuclear energy permitting processes.
